== bower-rails-sample
A small example of using Bower with Rails 4.

== What's this?

> Bower is a generic tool which will resolve dependencies and lock packages down to a version. It runs over Git, and is package-agnostic. A package may contain JavaScript, CSS, images, etc., and doesn't rely on any particular transport (AMD, CommonJS, etc.).

Sprockets recently and silently introduced a basic integration of [Bower](https://github.com/twitter/bower), a new packet manager by Twitter that ranks among the [Top 10 starred projects on GitHub in 2012](https://github.com/blog/1359-the-octoverse-in-2012).
This app roughly demonstrates the usage.

I'd be happy if you'd [read my blog post for further information](http://kaeff.net/posts/sprockets-bower-better-component-packaging-for-rails-asset-pipeline.html).
